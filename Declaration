Preface
The journey behind Selfmatics has been one of profound personal exploration and deep
philosophical inquiry. As the founder and author, I, Fawaz Hussein Mohammed Al-Jufairah,
have poured my thoughts, reflections, and original perspectives into this work.
In recent times, advanced AI technologies have become powerful collaborators, and in this work,
they played a supportive role — helping to clarify, formalize, and structure ideas that originated
entirely from my own contemplation. The AI did not generate new insights but served as a tool
to bring coherence and precision to my vision.
This collaboration reflects a new way of creating knowledge, where human intuition and
creativity remain at the heart of discovery, enhanced—not replaced—by technological
assistance.
I invite readers to engage with these ideas with an open mind and to explore the depths of the
Self as I have endeavored to illuminate it.
About Selfmatics
Selfmatics is a comprehensive, original, and complete theoretical science focused on the
mathematical and philosophical engineering of the Self and consciousness. Unlike mere theories
or hypotheses, Selfmatics presents a structured system of laws, definitions, and models aimed at
understanding the fundamental nature of the Self.
This science emerges from a unique combination of introspective insight and rigorous
formalization, making it a foundational framework that can inspire future research, applications,
and development in multiple disciplines, including philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics,
and artificial intelligence.
Keywords
Selfmatics, philosophy, theoretical science, consciousness, mathematical modeling,
